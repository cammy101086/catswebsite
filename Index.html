 	<p class="princessstory">These wonderful kittens were adopted by Camila Duran. The first one to join the 
 	team was <strong>Princess</strong>. She was found in a donation event. Several things about her made 
 	Camila believe that she would be an amazing addition to her family but the thing 
 	that convinced Camila into adopting Princess was her story. She had come from a very
 	rough past, yet she remained strong and happy.</p>

 	<img src="Images/monster.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="photo of adorable
 	skinny cat" title="monster the skinny cat">
 	<p class="monsterstory">Second one to join the family was <strong>Monster</strong>. Monster belonged to another family
 	before being a part of the Duran family. She was very loved but due to a rough time
 	within the family they could not keep her anymore. At that point she joined our 
 	family. Monster is a very loving cat. She loves to cuddle with humans, dogs and cats
 	.... pretty much anything that would hold her and make her feel loved!</p>

 <h6> Why should you adopt a pet?</h6>
 
 	<div class="leftparagraph">
 	<p>As it was mentioned before these wonderful kittens (ok ok.. cats!) came from very rough environments, some of them unfortunately were physically abused before joying the family. Cats around the world get abused at an alarming rate and the percentage of the ones that get a chance to join a happy family is not that high. That is why this page is up. To show you the stories of two different cats that were either abused or left behind after it got too difficult to have them. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="middleparagraph">
    <p>This page is to show that there is hope for all of them and that if we do try our best we can help at least one of them to be happy and safe. It is sad to see how many cats (or animals in general) are thrown away just because it is no longer convenient to have them or things got difficult. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="rightparagraph">
    <p>To prevent these kind of actions from animal owners there should be education. Knowing that there are ways to make it better for all and not just disregarding the pets like they are things. These animals feel, and I can tell from experience how happy they will be after being adopted and belonging to a home. Not only they will be happy, you do not know how much joy saving a life will bring to you. Adopt a pet!</p>
